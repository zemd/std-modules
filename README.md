# JavaScript Standard Modules

The package includes independent ESM-modules for various use cases.

> [!NOTE]  
> The library is in development mode. Many things are still under consideration and reflect my opinion that can change in future.

## Why use this library?

Over time projects tend to depend on numerous number of small packages. When this is happens it is called dependency hell. On the flip side there are highly coupled, but still very useful libraries like lodash, which people try to avoid because they want have more transparency and control over internals, so the tree-shaking was possible.

JavaScript ecosystem evolves, but still we need some simple solutions. The idea behind this library is to collect these simple solutions, that:

- easy to use on different platforms or runtimes,
- easy to include and compile, knowing that tree-shaking algorithm should not have additional AI module to reason about what is needed and what is not,
- they should not have big amount of dependencies, that what it means to be `std`
- and finally, even easy to copy. Did you like something? just copy into your project.

Each module should be easily bundled with it's dependencies or should not have any. So you can confidently import it and do not worry about dependency hell or that you need to import something additionally.

All modules are written in TypeScript and the package exports type definitions.
